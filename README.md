## 📌 Overview  
**Granite Docking RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a project built as part of **IBM SkillBuild Lab**.  
It integrates **Granite (IBM’s foundation model family)** with **Docking (information retrieval)** to create a powerful **RAG pipeline**.  

The system retrieves relevant knowledge from external sources and enhances responses generated by Granite models, ensuring **accuracy, contextual awareness, and reliability** in answers.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔎 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval with Granite for grounded answers.  
- 🧠 **Granite Foundation Models:** Utilizes IBM’s open-source foundation models for natural language understanding and generation.  
- ⚡ **Efficient Retrieval:** Docking mechanism ensures precise knowledge integration.  
- 🛠️ **Scalable & Modular:** Easily extendable for different use cases (chatbots, research assistants, knowledge management).  
- 🔐 **Enterprise Ready:** Secure, reliable, and aligned with IBM’s AI governance.

## 🏗️ Architecture  
1. **User Query** → Sent to RAG pipeline.  
2. **Retriever (Docking)** → Finds relevant chunks from the knowledge base.  
3. **Granite Model** → Generates an answer, enhanced with retrieved context.  
4. **Response** → Returned to user with improved factual accuracy.
